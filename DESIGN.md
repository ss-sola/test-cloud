## Overview

Corporate flat design landing page. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. Corporate flat design didn't win on merit alone — it won on safety. When Microsoft stripped Chrome of its Aero glass in 2012 and Google flattened everything into Material, enterprise teams finally had permission to stop pretending skeuomorphism was necessary. The boardroom exhaled. Clean geometry, solid colors, predictable grids. Nobody gets fired for choosing flat.

And that's precisely the tension. Flat became the uniform of serious software — the navy suit of interface design. It signals competence, structure, reliability. Every enterprise SaaS from 2014 onward adopted some version of it because it photographs well in pitch decks and offends absolutely no one. The visual language of "we are a real company."

But here's what nobody says out loud: most corporate flat design is boring on purpose. The trade-off is real. You gain instant credibility and cross-cultural neutrality. You lose memorability. You lose the thing that makes someone actually enjoy using your tool on a Tuesday afternoon. The best practitioners know this and smuggle personality back in through motion, spacing rhythm, and typographic choices — not through the color palette.

## Elevation & Depth

Sharp corners, solid colors, clean typography, intuitive icons, simple animations, clear visual hierarchy, focus on usability, grid-based layout

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 480ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 100ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.

## Shapes

Base corner radius: 4px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.
